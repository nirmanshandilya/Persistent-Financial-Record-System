🏦 Robust Bank Management System (C++)

A high-performance CLI application designed for persistent financial record management. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Binary File Serialization, and 64-bit Architecture Compatibility in C++.


🚀 Key Features

1. Persistent Data Storage: Uses binary file handling (fstream) to ensure all user records and balances are saved permanently to disk.
2. Secure Transactions: Integrated logic for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiries with real-time file updates.
3. 64-bit Optimized: Refactored for modern systems using std::streamoff to prevent memory overflow during file-seeking operations.
4. Validation Engine: Implemented checks for insufficient funds, account existence, and data integrity.



🛠️ Technical Stack

Language: C++11 / C++14
Concepts: File I/O (Binary), Encapsulation, Stream Manipulation, Error Handling.
